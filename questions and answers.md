> Why do you want join Ada Developers Academy? Why are you interested in programming? Tell us about your journey thus far to learn about and confirm your interest in programming.  

**Sulian:** I'm interested in programming because it can make me work creativity and with my intelligence. When I learned C in college, I tried to use it to design an interface to deal with the data in the experiment. It saves time and prevents me from doing tedious tasks. It is amazing to think like a computer. Even as a housewife, I still insist on self-studying programming, learning such as **Java, PHP, HTML, MySQL, Python** and so on. Then using them to design some simple games(i.e. SpaceInvades). I've also designed on bootstrap. I have always wanted to be a proficient programmer or software developers. When I heard of Ada, especially the Vision, Mission of it, I feel excited because it can build my confidence and break me into the career in Tech industry.

> Tell us about a time you made a mistake. What did you learn? What would you do differently?   

**Sulian:** I have strong study ability to learn, and I am very interested in programming. When I first wrote a game program in Java, I thought I needed to get a perfect start page, and then I went to learn how to get a page and how to beautify it. I didn't realize that I need to solve the core problem first. So I spent a lot of time in the Non-core section. From this process I learned that when I do a everything, I should make a schedule in advance to grasp the main problems and then solve the secondary problems, so that I can use time rationally and effectively.
