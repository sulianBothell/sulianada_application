> Tell us about your journey thus far to learn about and confirm your interest in programming. What do you love about programming? What is hardest about programming? 

**Suian:**  I'm interested in programming because it can make me work creativity and with my intelligence. When I learned C in college, I tried to use it to design an interface to deal with the data in the experiment. It saves time and prevents me from doing tedious tasks. It is amazing to think like a computer. Even as a housewife, I still insist on self-studying programming, learning such as **Java, PHP, HTML, MySQL, Python** and so on. Then using them to design some simple games(i.e. SpaceInvades). I've also designed on bootstrap. I have always wanted to be a proficient programmer or software developers.

I my opinion, the hardest about programming is **how to think like a computer**.  It is hard to convert the vague, intuitive, emotional needs of users into forms a computer can interpret.

> Where do you see your career in the next five years? What will be your impact in the Tech field, especially as it relates to Adaâ€™s mission?  
  
**Sulian:**  If I am accepted into the Ada Dev Academy program I see myself being a **professional programmer** for the company. Also I see myself continually learning new skills that will benefit the company and help me achieve my career goals. I will learn to overcome myself every day! I am eager to experience new challenges and excited to invest five years time specializing in a career I find extremely interesting and motivating.

At the same time being a **management role**. This would allow me to makes an impact on more women entering the Tech industry. It is not going to be easy, but it will be worth it.


> Tell us about a time you failed. What happened? What did you learn from the experience? What would you do differently?  

**Sulian:** I have strong study ability to learn, and I am very intetested in programming. When I first wrote a game program in Java, I thought I needed to get a perfect start page, and then I went to learn how to get a page and how to beautify it. I didn't realize that I need to solve the core problem first. So I spent a lot of time in the Non-core section. From this process I learned that when I do a everything, I should make a schedule in advance to grasp the main problems and then solve the secondary problems, so that I can use time rationally and effectively.
